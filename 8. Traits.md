Whenever you or your crew successfully defuse a situation that was heading toward a fight, clear a mark of [[5. Mires & Trauma|mire]].

Elves perceive what others overlook. When detecting danger, noticing subtle details, or reacting to sudden changes treat partial successes as full successes.

**Whisperstep** 2-Track Trait
Tread lightly, leaving almost no trace. When moving quietly, crossing natural terrain, or slipping past attention, you gain +1d. You may push yourself to vanish from view in a swirl of foliage, shadow, or starlight—gaining a brief window of perfect concealment.

**Timeworn Resilience** 3-Track Trait
Long lifespans have taught elves how to outlast hardship. Clear 1 more mire during downtime or +1d on mental strains.

Long life breeds patience. Gain +1d on actions requiring multi-step planning. You may also assist an ally in a plan dealing with timed elements without marking mire.

**I Used to Know This** 3-Track Trait
