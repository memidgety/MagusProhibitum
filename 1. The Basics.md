## The Game
Magus Prohibitum is a game about a group of outcasts building their reputation in a city of possibilities. The world is an industrial-fantasy, with machines, towering buildings, magical creatures and the occasional magic spell being thrown. There are heists, investigations, shady deals, back-alley brawls, lies, betrayal, victories and defeats.

## The Setting
The year stands at the edge of a new century. For centuries, since the Renaissance first cracked open the hidden corners of the world, magical creatures lived openly among humankind. But the Magus War, a brutal conflict of spells, machines, and ideology, left nations scorched and societies fractured. In its wake, Magus Prohibitum fell: the practice of magic outlawed, its grim toll deemed too dangerous for ordinary hands. Now technology surges into the vacuum, industrial innovation pushing forward with renewed ferocity as arcane power is driven underground. Yet the embers of sorcery still glow. Governments wield sanctioned magic in secret chambers, syndicates traffic in illegal spellcraft, and creatures bound by old truths navigate a world increasingly built of steel, smoke, and suspicion. It is an age of invention balanced on the bones of forbidden power, an era where the future is claimed by those bold enough to straddle both worlds.

## The Players
Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the crew to which their characters belong. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring professional who reaches boldly beyond their current safety and means. This is the players’ core responsibility: they engage with the premise of the game, seeking out interesting opportunities for crime in the world - taking big risks against powerful foes and sending their characters into danger.

The players work together with the Game Master to establish the tone and style of the game by making judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM.
