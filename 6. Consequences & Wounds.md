## Consequences
Enemy actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict consequences on a PC. They range from Reduced Effect, a Complication, Lost opportunity, losing position, and harm.

### Reduced Effect
___
This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC’s action isn’t as effective as they’d anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a flesh wound. She accepts the forged invitation, but she’ll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You’re able to scale the wall, but it’s slow going—you’re only halfway up. This consequence essentially reduces the effect level of the PC’s action by one after all other factors are accounted for.
### Complication
___
This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem that results from the action right now: the room catches fire, you’re disarmed, the crew takes +1 heat from evidence or witnesses, you lose status with a faction, the target evades you and now it’s a chase, reinforcements arrive, etc.

Or the GM might tick a clock for the complication, instead. Maybe there’s a clock for the alert level of the guards at the manor. Or maybe the GM creates a new clock for the suspicion of the noble guests at the masquerade party and ticks it. Fill one tick on a clock for a minor complication or two ticks for a standard complication.

A serious complication is more severe: reinforcements surround and trap you, the room catches fire and falling ceiling beams block the door, your weapon is broken, the crew suffers +2 heat, your target escapes out of sight, etc. Fill three ticks on a clock for a serious complication. 
### lost opportunity
___
This consequence represents shifting circumstance. You had an opportunity to
achieve your goal with this action, but it slips away. To try again, you need a new
approach - usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances. Maybe
you tried to Skirmish with the noble to trap her on the balcony, but she evades
your maneuver and leaps out of reach. If you want to trap her now you’ll have to
try another way - maybe by Swaying her with your roguish charm.




## Wounds
This consequence represents a longer-lasting debility. When you take damage, you take damage to your traits. If all the boxes of a trait are marked, you lose the ability to use the trait until you clear at least one box of the trait. These marked traits represent the number of wounds and how capable the character is. Once a certain number of wounds are reached, penalties start to hinder your performance. 

| Wounds | 5 Wounds       | 10 Wounds | 15 Wounds | 20 Wounds   | 25+       |
| ------ | -------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Effect | Reduced Impact | -1d       | Cut 1     | Compromised | Repeating |

*Note: Some traits mark themselves, representing a toll on the body for their use*

When a player takes 20 wounds, they become Compromised - losing capability related to what caused the wound. For instance, a character might be Compromised after sword fighting, losing the ability to use an arm, tearing their tendons, and there for not be able to use their two handed rifle. This extends to non-physical Compromises, such as a diplomat losing Confidence after a harsh debate, or a wizard losing their ability to focus their magic. Whatever the Compromised state of the character, they can keep acting in any other way that does not interfere with the Compromise until they recover enough wounds to lose the compromised state.

At 25 wounds+, the table repeats itself, adding additional stacking debuffs. A player would have greatly reduced impact, -2d, Cut 2, to another Compromised state.

When a player takes damage, they can instead opt to mark mire (see [[5. Mires & Trauma#Resisting damage|Resisting Damage|]]).
