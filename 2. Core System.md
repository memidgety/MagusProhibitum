## THE CONVERSATION
A roleplaying game is a conversation between the GM and the players, punctuated
by dice rolls to inject uncertainty and surprising turns.

The GM presents the fictional situation in which the player characters find themselves. The players determine the actions of their characters in response to the situation. The GM and the players together judge how the game systems are engaged. The outcomes of the mechanics then change the situation, leading into a new phase of the conversation—new situations, new actions, new
judgments, new rolls—creating an ongoing fiction and building “the story” of the game, organically, from a series of discrete moments.

**No one is in charge of the story.** The story is what happens as a result of the situation
presented by the GM, the actions the characters take, the outcomes of the mechanics,
and the consequences that result. The story emerges from the unpredictable collision
of all of these elements. You play to find out what the story will be.

## JUDGMENT CALLS
Since roleplaying is a collaborative, expressive act, not a purely strategic endeavor, you’ll need to make judgment calls. By making these choices, the game group together establishes a style, tone, and form of fiction unique to their instance of play. Magus Prohibitum is designed to bring these judgment calls to the forefront and make them explicit tools of the game.
When you play, you’ll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:
- Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? Can this person be
swayed? Must we get out the tools and tinker with this old rusty lock, or could it also be quietly finessed? The players have final say.
- How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot? The GM has final say.
- Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given
circumstance? Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Do the Bluecoats merely
become suspicious or do they already have you trapped? The GM has final say.
- Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? Is your scoundrel in position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative? The GM has final say.
- Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and crew advancement? Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, heritage, or background? You tell us. The players have final say.

The particular choices you make will create your own unique form of Magus Prohibitum. You’ll say something about the world and the characters, about crime fiction, and even about the human condition. What will you say? There’s only one way to find out.
## ROLLING THE DICE
---
Magus Prohibitum uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the single highest result.

- If the highest die is a **6**, it’s a **full success**—things go well. If you roll more than one 6, it’s a critical success—you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a **4** or **5**, that’s a **partial or mixed success**—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.
-  If the highest die is **1-3**, it’s a **bad outcome**. Things go poorly. You probably don’t achieve your goal and you suffer complications, too.

|      Roll      | Failure | Partial Success | Full Success |
| :------------: | :-----: | :-------------: | :----------: |
| Track Progress |         |        ■        |      ■■      |

If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a full success when you have zero dice.

**The most common result is 4/5:** partial success. This means that your character will tend to succeed, but at a cost—you’ll rarely get away clean. Magus Prohibitum is a game about underdog characters who are in over their heads. The dice mechanic reinforces this by making partial success crop up again and again. This is a good thing! Trouble is where the fun of the game happens.

To create a dice pool for a roll, you’ll take a dice for an attribute (like your Grace or your Wit), then take dice equal to the skill. You’ll usually end up with one to five dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game—a 50% chance of success.  A player might roll 1 Might and 1 Break for a total of 2  when they fight an enemy, for example.
 
### POSITION
The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s position. There are three positions: **controlled, risky**, and **desperate**. If you’re in a controlled position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a desperate position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in between, it’s risky - usually considered the “default” position for most actions. 

|  Position   | Controlled | Risky | Desperate |
| :---------: | :--------: | :---: | :-------: |
| Consequence |   ■𐄂𐄂    | ■■𐄂  |    ■■■    |

### IMPACT
In situations where something has a serious effect on a track, you'll be able to mark more than the standard two boxes. Each additional Impact adds a mark, while reduced impact removes a mark. If you have no impact for a particular action, it is best to try another angle.

## Loaded Deal
---
Often times when a player has overreached their goal, needed an utmost success, or just desperate for power - they can call for a Loaded Deal. The GM or any other Player can offer a bonus dice if you accept a penalty. Common deals include but are not limited to:
  
- Collateral damage, unintended harm.
- Sacrifice coin or an item.
- Betray a friend or loved one.
- Offend or anger a faction.
- Start and/or mark a troublesome track.
- Add heat to the crew from evidence or witnesses.
- Suffer wounds.

The consequences of the deal always happen regardless of the roll - you have accepted the deal. 
## Cutting
---
Sometimes an action might be particularly difficult. In this situation a Cut may be called. ‘Cutting’ a dice roll is represented by removing a number of results after the roll is made, starting with the highest. The larger the cut, the less likely you’ll get a straight success or doubles.

### Cutting for Difficulty
If the action you’re attempting is particularly unlikely to succeed, the Firefly will ask you to cut for difficulty. Sometimes it means you’re attempting a harder-than- average action (such as climbing onto the back of a rampaging beast versus climbing a wall), sometimes that you’re approaching a task in a way that makes it less likely you’ll succeed (such as trying to pick a lock with a splinter of bone rather than a normal lockpick). The Firefly will usually warn you of cut as you describe your approach. This gives you a chance to reconsider your methods, try to get the most out of your dice pool, or at least ready yourself for a higher chance of disaster.
### Cutting for Precision
When in combat with a creature, you can cut 1 result to aim at a particular part with precision. This often allows you to deny the creature access to some of its special abilities, or to deal extra damage by hitting a weak point. Cutting for precision is voluntary, but must be requested before you roll.
### Cutting for Impact
If you want to achieve more than you’d usually be able to, you can cut 1 result for extra impact (you’ll find more information on impact in the next column). Cutting for extra impact is voluntary, but you have to request it before you roll your dice. From the Jaws of Victory Cutting often leads to unexpected conflicts and failures, so play into that as the conversation continues! You were so close - what went wrong? Or, if you managed a decent success even with the cut, how did your character pull that off against the odds?
