Defining Item
On character creation or as you pick up other professions, each character gets a single Defining item they are known to carry. This item has 1 less load and is always available if the narrative allows (if you are chained to a chair with all your possession in another room, you do not have it.)


loadout
You have access to all of the items on your character sheet. For each operation, decide what your character’s load will be. During the operation, you may say that your character has an item on hand by checking the box for the item you want to use—up to a number of items equal to your chosen load. Your load also determines your movement speed and conspicuousness: 
- 1-3 load: Light. You’re faster, less conspicuous; you blend in with citizens. 
- 4/5 load: Normal. You look like a scoundrel, ready for trouble. 
- 6 load: Heavy. You’re slower. You look like an operative on a mission. 
- 7-9 load: Encumbered. You’re overburdened and can’t do anything except move very slowly. Some special abilities (like the Cutter’s Mule ability or a Demon’s incredible strength) increase the load limits. Some items count as two items for load (they have two connected boxes). Items in italics don’t count toward your load. You don’t need to select specific items now. Review your personal items and the standard item descriptions on page 88
