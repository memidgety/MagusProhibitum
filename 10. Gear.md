## Defining Item
On character creation or as you pick up other professions, each character gets a single Defining item they are known to carry. This item has 1 less load and is always available if the narrative allows (if you are chained to a chair with all your possession in another room, you do not have it.)

## Loadout
You have access to all of the items on your character sheet. For each job, decide what your character’s load will be. During the job, you may say that your character has an item on hand by checking the box for the item you want to use—up to a number of items equal to your chosen load. Your load also determines your movement speed and conspicuousness: 
- **1-3 load**: Light. You’re faster, less conspicuous; you blend in with citizens. 
- **4/5 load**: Normal. You look like a scoundrel, ready for trouble. 
- **6 load:** Heavy. You’re slower. You look like an operative on a mission. 
- **7-9 load**: Encumbered. You’re overburdened and can’t do anything except move very slowly. Some special abilities increase the load limits. Some items count as two items for load (they have two connected boxes). Items in italics don’t count toward your load. You don’t need to select specific items now. 

## ARMOR
If you have a type of armor that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist. Silas is taking level 2 harm, “Cut to the Ribs,” and the fight isn’t even over yet, so Ian decides to use Silas’s armor to reduce the harm. He marks the armor box and the harm becomes level 1, “Bruised.” If Silas was wearing heavy armor, he could mark a second armor box and reduce the harm again, to zero. When an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your load for the next score. See Loadout, page 57.
