## Magus Prohibitum

The year stands at the edge of a new century. For centuries, since the Renaissance first cracked open the hidden corners of the world, magical creatures lived openly among humankind. But the Magus War, a brutal conflict of spells, machines, and ideology, left nations scorched and societies fractured. In its wake, Magus Prohibitum fell: the practice of magic outlawed, its grim toll deemed too dangerous for ordinary hands. Now technology surges into the vacuum, industrial innovation pushing forward with renewed ferocity as arcane power is driven underground. Yet the embers of sorcery still glow. Governments wield sanctioned magic in secret chambers, syndicates traffic in illegal spellcraft, and creatures bound by old truths navigate a world increasingly built of steel, smoke, and suspicion. It is an age of invention balanced on the bones of forbidden power, an era where the future is claimed by those bold enough to straddle both worlds.
