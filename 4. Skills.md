## Skill Ranks
Each of your character’s skills has a rank, starting at one and topping out at four. When used as part of an action, skills add a number of d6s to your dice pool equal to their rank plus an attribute that could be used in said action. For example, Laura uses Sway to convince a gang boss to let the crew work in his territory, but she also adds on her Vigor as she is hard headed and determined to get what she wants. 

### Crossover
There are multiple skills on this list that share some thematic space, rubbing shoulders with others in terms of what they might let you do. This is by design - it allows your skills to be more easily flavored by the attribute you choose, giving an added level of flexibility and letting you apply them to unexpected events.
In essence, try to view your skills as something you can and should bend to fit a new situation, just as you would in real life. The GM may reduce your impact or apply cut if the circumstances of using a skill are particularly tenuous, but these are limits you’ll find at your table through the course of play.

### Helping Hands
A well-put-together crew will have a variety of skills to call on, but sometimes what one character wants to do may be better-rolled by another in the group. In these cases, two crewmembers can work together on the same task, but they are both affected by any negatives that may result from rolling a conflict or disaster.
