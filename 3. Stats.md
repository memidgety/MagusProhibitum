## Attributes

Attributes represent the way your character is most used to solving problems and tackling challenges, the approaches they’re usually the most effective with. Magus Prohibitum has seven Attributes: **Might, Vigor, Grace, Focus, Wit, Presence**, and **Arcana**.  
When you attempt something using an attribute, you’re in your element - when rolling, you can add 1d6 to your dice pool. Attributes also add a lot of narrative flavor to the rest of an action roll, changing the way a skill or aspect gets used in play. Rolling to gather magical essence using the Arcana edge might mean you’re focusing on quality, whereas rolling with Wit might let you gather those essences without letting anyone else know. For example, Laura uses Sway to convince a gang boss to let the crew work in his territory, but she also adds on her Vigor as she is hard-headed and determined to get what she wants. Another character might have used Sway with Presence, leaning on sheer force of personality to dominate the conversation and make cooperation feel inevitable.
