The rules don’t distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When an operation is underway, you can invoke a flashback to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. *Maybe you convinced the district Watch sergeant to cancel the patrol tonight, so you make a Sway roll to see how that went.* The GM sets a [[5. Mires & Trauma|mire]] cost when you activate a flashback action.

- **0 Mire:** An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity. *The Strongarm Consorted with her friend Chael to agree to arrive at the dice game ahead of time, to suddenly spring out as a surprise ally.*
- **1 Mire:** A complex action or unlikely opportunity. *The Detective Finessed his pistols into a hiding spot near the card table so he could retrieve them after the pat-down at the front door.*
- **2 (or more) Mire**: An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies. *The Wizard has already Studied the history of the property and learned of a ghost that is known to haunt its ancient canal dock - a ghost that can be compelled to reveal the location of the hidden vault.*

After the mire cost is paid, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail an action roll, because there’s some danger or trouble involved. Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won’t call for a roll at all because you can just pay the stress and it’s accomplished. If a flashback involves a [[11. Long Rests|long rest]] activity, pay 1 cash, instead of mire. One of the best uses for a flashback is when the start of a job goes poorly. After the GM describes the trouble you’re in, you can call for a flashback to a special preparation you made, “just in case” something like this happened. This way, your “flashback planning” will be focused on the problems that do happen, not the problems that might happen. 

## Limits of Flashbacks 
A flashback isn’t time travel. It can’t “undo” something that just occurred in the present moment. For instance, if Inspector Helker confronts you about recent thefts of occult artifacts when you’re at Lady Bowmore’s party, you can’t call for a flashback to assassinate the Inspector the night before. She’s here now, questioning you - that’s established in the fiction. You can call for a flashback to show that you intentionally tipped off the inspector so she would confront you at the party - so you could use that opportunity to impress Lady Bowmore with your self confidence and daring.
