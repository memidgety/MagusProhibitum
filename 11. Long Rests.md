After the crew finishes a score (succeed or fail), they take time to recover, regroup, and prepare for the next job. This is called a Long Rest. A Long Rest symbolizes a long enough time that rolling dice for each action would not be feasible.  

A Long Rest is divided into 4 parts
1. Pay. The Crew receives rewards for their last job
2. Rep. The Crew adjust their reputation
3. Snares. Other factions make their move alongside the Crew
4. Rest. Characters prepare, recover, or advance other projects

## Pay
The Crew gain **cash** based on the nature of the job they just did.

- **2 Cash**: A minor job - Low risk, limited reach, minimal fallout
- **4 Cash**: A small job - Focused job, localized impact
- **6 Cash**: A standard job - Crew-defining work, meaningful consequences
- **8 Cash**: A big job - High stakes, public impact, dangerous enemies
- **10+ Cash:** A major Job - Campaign-altering, historic repercussions

A minor job may be locating someone's possessions or spreading a rumor. A small job might be to smuggling illegal goods through a single area. A Standard Job may be to steal goods from a protected site or stop a dangerous occupation from another faction. A Big Job affects the city as a whole - stealing from a bank, dismantling a faction, or attacking a major power. A Major Job would be the culminating event of an arc - overthrowing the government, ending a faction war, to reshaping culture in the region.


## Rep
The Crew gains reputation while doing jobs. Anything that you do will leave witnesses and evidence behind - wanted or unwanted. Rep symbolizes how the other factions see the Crew. After a job, the Crew gains or loses rep according to the job.

- 2 Rep: Positive exposure; aligning with the Crew's motives
- 1 Rep: Good Exposure; a simple job well done
- 0 Rep: Neither good nor bad exposure; things did not go to plan
- -1 Rep: Bad Exposure; something went wrong
- -2 Rep: Negative Exposure; something that does not align with the crew's motives, something when terribly wrong

#### Rep Modifiers
There are a few conditions on a job that will drastically affect how much Rep a crew gains. If the Target is well connected, 1 Rep is added. If murder was involved subtract 2 Rep (unless the crew are assassins). Rep modifiers can also be added or subtracted from Critical Successes, Loaded Deals, or regular Consequences. 

## Snares
The Crew is not the only faction vying for power in the region - other factions will move in parallel to achieve their goals. After each job, rolling for Snares represents issues with other factions as time progresses.

## Rest

Rest is where a Character can pursue interests outside of the job - Tend to their wounds,  Acquire an asset, work on a long-term project, Hone their skills, or indulge in their vices. 
### Healing Wounds

*wip* 

Everyone heals 2 Wounds in each Long Rest. You can take a Heal Activitiy to get half of your traits rounded down.
