## Mires
Mires are the tolls of pushing ones self to the brink. Mires take the form of insecurities, bad habits, phobias, coping mechanisms, or savage tendencies. Every Character has three Mires, chosen during character creation. Each mire has a 3 box track. 

When a Mire is marked, it starts to effect the Character. 

▪▫▫ If **one box** of a mire is marked, let hints of the condition bleed through into your roleplay. Perhaps you shy away from choices that would usually be easy, or bring the effects of the mire into a description of a related action. 

▪▪▫ If **two boxes** of a mire are marked, the mire should be at the forefront of your roleplay when possible, informing your choice of words and actions. 

▪▪▪ If **all boxes** of a mire are marked, things you'd usually be able to do might be impossible. Whenever you try to act in a way that contradicts the mire, you automatically take a cut (such as trying to balance on a high branch with a mire marked that relates to instability or vertigo). You may not be able to quell fears or vices, and the way you describe your actions to the other players should make it clear that your character is suffering.

## Using Mire
Characters have a special reserve of fortitude and luck they can take advantage of. When calling upon that reservoir, mark a mire. Mire can be used in a number of ways, from decreasing damage taken, to pushing yourself for better results.
### Pushing yourself
You can use Mire to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you
choose below, mark 2 Mire (each can be chosen once for a given action):
-  Add +1d to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)
-  Add +1 level to your effect.
-  Take action when you’re incapacitated.

The ability to push yourself for +1d means you effectively have at least 1d in every action as long as you have stress to burn. Even 1d gives you a 50/50 chance of success. This is the core “scoundrel’s luck” in the game system. Even when you’re in a bad spot, trying to do something for which you have no experience or training, you can dig deep and give yourself a chance. (A much better chance than rolling 2d and taking the lowest when you have zero dots.) It’s important to remember this! Some players tend to forget and dismiss actions for which they have zero dots. *“Nah, I can’t do that. I don’t have Attune. I’d have to roll 2d and take the worst.”* As long as you have stress to burn, you can get 1d and give any action a decent shot.

### Resisting damage
When taking any form of damage, you can mark any number of stress instead of taking that many marks on your traits. Stress does not count towards the tally for wounds.

### Aiding an Ally
You may aid an ally with an action, marking 1 mire and giving them +1d. Narratively state how you help them.

## Trauma
When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of trauma. When you take trauma, circle one of your trauma conditions like Cold, Reckless, Unstable, etc.

When you suffer trauma, you’re taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, you have zero stress and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime (see Vice on page 156).

Trauma conditions are permanent. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. When you mark your fourth trauma condition, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life or send them to prison to take the fall for the crew’s wanted level.
